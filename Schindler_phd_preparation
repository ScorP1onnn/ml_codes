He Used two supervised machine learning algorithms, support vector machines and random forests

He has already worked on these two. I think he would be looking for a student who can implement deep neural networks as a starting test

Also learn how to fit a quasar X-Shooter spectrum (especailly his tools, maybe): LEARN SCULPTOR
